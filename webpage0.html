  <title>Discovery of calculus</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <strong>calculus was discovered by two scientists at the same time and those are </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Newton
        <li>Leibniz
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li><h1>Calculus by Newton</h1>
              Newton was phyisicts and he was really concerned about the different rates of changes of various things like velocity and distance.
              So he invented differnical calculus that specifically dealt with variable rate changes.
              <li><h1>Calculus by Leibniz</h1>
                Leibniz was a mathematican and he was working on problems related to area under the curve so he started working on maths that specifically worked with area on cartian plain.
                today we know this as integral calculus.
                </ol>
            Though both geniues invented and published there papers at the sametime and both their finds compelet the subject of calculus we know today. But newton had more influence in
            science society so he tired his best to undermine Leibniz's finds and outshined his own and to a certain degree he succeded as well and widely people give cerdit to Newton for invention of calculus.
